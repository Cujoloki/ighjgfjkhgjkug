# Farm Production Record Management Application - Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Farm Production Record Management Application to fix functionality issues and restore proper operation.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Components
- Created the missing `RowsPage.tsx` component that was referenced in App.tsx but didn't exist
- Implemented full functionality for managing rows including:
  - Listing all rows
  - Adding new rows
  - Editing existing rows
  - Deleting rows
  - Filtering rows by plot

### 2. Missing Configuration Files
- Created the missing `lib/supabase.ts` file for Supabase configuration
- Added proper environment variable handling for Supabase URL and API key
- Added error handling for missing configuration

### 3. Missing Authentication Components
- Created the missing `AuthContext.tsx` for managing authentication state
- Implemented the `AuthProvider` component to wrap the application
- Created the `AuthButton.tsx` component for user login/logout functionality
- Added proper session management with Supabase Auth

### 4. Fixed Git Diff Markers
Several files contained git diff markers instead of proper code, which were fixed:
- Fixed `App.tsx` to properly import and use components
- Fixed `RowForm.tsx` to include plot selection functionality
- Fixed `Layout.tsx` to include the Dashboard navigation item
- Fixed `plots_GET.ts` endpoint to use proper SQL syntax for empty array defaults

## Application Structure
The application now has a complete structure with:

1. **Pages**
   - Dashboard Page: Overview of farm data
   - Plots Page: Management of plots
   - Rows Page: Management of rows

2. **Components**
   - Layout: Main application layout with navigation
   - AuthButton: Authentication UI
   - PlotSelector: Component for selecting plots
   - PlotCategoryManager: Component for managing plot categories
   - RowForm: Form for creating and editing rows
   - VoiceCommandPanel: Voice command interface

3. **Services**
   - plotService: API calls for plot management
   - rowService: API calls for row management

4. **Context**
   - AuthContext: Authentication state management
